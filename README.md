# DailyReminders

When life gets busy, sometimes it just gets difficult to perform an action until it becomes a routine.
Things such as remembering to check up on something online or eating your vitamins day after day becomes a hassle.
What this application aims to do is to remind its user from day to day, week to week, or month to month.
How this differs from other reminders is that until you acknowledge it individually within your app, it will keep reminding you from time.
This means that if you're out of your house and can't eat your vitamins, the notification sent to you at 5:00pm won't matter as much because you'll probably get another one at 6:00pm.
It's a very simple application, but hopefully will come with a lot of flexibility and compatibility.
